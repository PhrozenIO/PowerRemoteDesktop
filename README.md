# Power Remote Desktop

<img src="Assets/prdp-banner.png" width="100%"/>

Welcome to **Power Remote Desktop** for remote desktop access in pure PowerShell! This module offers a unique solution for remotely controlling one or multiple screens using only PowerShell. Unlike other remote desktop tools that rely on external protocols and software, our module utilizes its own  remote desktop protocol.

The module consists of both a client and a server component, both of which are written entirely in PowerShell. Our protocol provides secure, encrypted communication using TLS and offers both challenge-based password authentication and certificate-based authentication.

In addition to providing full mouse and keyboard control over the remote desktop, our module also replicates the mouse cursor icon for the viewer, synchronizes the clipboard between the local and remote systems, and more. Despite the limitations of PowerShell, we have implemented techniques to optimize network traffic and improve the streaming experience, resulting in a smooth and efficient remote desktop experience.

At the time of writing, this is the only known entirely PowerShell-based remote desktop application. We hope you find it useful and we welcome any feedback or suggestions you may have.

Tested on:

* **Windows 10**
* **Windows 11**

Current version: **4.0.0 Stable**

## Performance

For a better streaming performance and overall experience, we recommend using PowerShell 7 instead of PowerShell 5.

You can install PowerShell 7 for Windows [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/fr-fr/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-on-windows?view=powershell-7.2)

## Highlighted Features

<img src="Assets/image31.png" width="100%"/>

* Remote Desktop Streaming: This feature allows you to stream the desktop of the remote computer to your own device. The streaming supports HDPI and scaling, providing a high-quality display on various screens and resolutions.
* Remote Control: With this feature, you can control the mouse (including moves, clicks, and wheel) and keyboard of the remote computer as if you were sitting in front of it.
* Secure: To protect the privacy and security of your remote desktop sessions, the module uses TLSv1.2 or 1.3 to encrypt the network traffic. Access to the server is granted through a challenge-based authentication mechanism that requires a user-defined complex password.
* Network Traffic Encryption: The module supports encrypting the network traffic using either a default X509 certificate or your own custom X509 certificate (recommended).
* Server Certificate Fingerprint Validation: To ensure the authenticity of the server, the module allows you to validate the fingerprint of the server certificate and optionally persist this validation between sessions.
* Clipboard Synchronization: This feature allows you to synchronize the clipboard text between the viewer (your device) and the server (the remote computer). You can easily copy and paste text between the two systems.
* Mouse Cursor Icon Synchronization: The module also synchronizes the state of the mouse cursor icon between the viewer (virtual desktop) and the server, providing a more seamless and intuitive remote desktop experience.
* Multi-Screen Support: If the remote computer has more than one desktop screen, you can choose which screen to capture and stream to your device.
* View Only Mode: This feature allows you to disable remote control abilities and simply view the screen of the remote computer. It can be useful for demonstrations or presentations.
* Session Concurrency: Multiple viewers can connect to a single server at the same time, allowing multiple users to collaborate on the same remote desktop.
* Sleep Mode Prevention: To ensure that the remote desktop remains active and responsive, the module prevents the remote computer from entering sleep mode while it is waiting for viewers to connect.
* Streaming Optimization: To improve the streaming speed, the module only sends updated pieces of the desktop to the viewer, reducing the amount of data transmitted over the network.

## Setup everything in less than a minute (Fast Setup)

````powershell
Install-Module -Name PowerRemoteDesktop_Server

Invoke-RemoteDesktopServer -CertificateFile "<certificate_location>"
````

If you want to avoid using your own certificate and prefer not to go through the process of creating one, you can remove the 'CertificateFile'. A default certificate will be created on local user certificate store (not recommended)

````powershell
Install-Module -Name PowerRemoteDesktop_Viewer

Invoke-RemoteDesktopViewer -ServerAddress "<ip_address>" -Password "<the_one_displayed_on_server>"
````

Thats it üòâ

## Detailed Installation and Instructions

There are several ways to use this PowerShell application. The recommended method is to install both the server and viewer components using the PowerShell Gallery. Alternatively, you can install them as modules or import them as scripts manually. Choose the method that best fits your needs and preferences.

### Install as a PowerShell Module from PowerShell Gallery (**Recommended**)

You can install Power Remote Desktop from the PowerShell Gallery, which is similar to Aptitude for Debian or Brew for MacOS. To do so, run the following commands: 

```powershell
Install-Module -Name PowerRemoteDesktop_Server

Install-Module -Name PowerRemoteDesktop_Viewer
```

`AllowPrerelease` is mandatory when current version is marked as a *Prerelease*

When you run the command, you may see the following warning in your command prompt:

```
Untrusted repository
You are installing the modules from an untrusted repository. If you trust this repository, change its
InstallationPolicy value by running the Set-PSRepository cmdlet. Are you sure you want to install the modules from
'PSGallery'?
```

Type 'Y' to confirm and proceed with the installation. When the installation is complete, both modules should be available. You can verify this by running the following command: 

```powershell
Get-Module -ListAvailable
```

Example Output:

```
PS C:\Users\Phrozen\Desktop> Get-Module -ListAvailable


    Directory: C:\Users\Phrozen\Documents\WindowsPowerShell\Modules


ModuleType Version    Name                                ExportedCommands
---------- -------    ----                                ----------------
Manifest   1.0.0      PowerRemoteDesktop_Server           Invoke-RemoteDesktopServer
Manifest   1.0.0      PowerRemoteDesktop_Viewer           Invoke-RemoteDesktopViewer

<..snip..>
```

If the modules are not showing up, try running the following commands and then check again: 

```powershell
Import-Module PowerRemoteDesktop_Server

Import-Module PowerRemoteDesktop_Viewer
```

### Install as a PowerShell Module (Manually / Unmanaged)

In order for a module to be available, it must be located in a registered module path. You can view the registered module paths by running the following command: 

```powershell
Write-Output $env:PSModulePath
```

Example Output:

```
C:\Users\Phrozen\Documents\WindowsPowerShell\Modules;C:\Program Files\WindowsPowerShell\Modules;C:\WINDOWS\system32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\Modules
```

Clone PowerRemoteDesktop repository or download a Github release package.

```
git clone https://github.com/DarkCoderSc/PowerRemoteDesktop.git
```

Copy both *PowerRemoteDesktop_Viewer* and *PowerRemoteDesktop_Server* folders to desired module path 

Example: 

```
C:\Users\<USER>\Documents\WindowsPowerShell\Modules
```

Both modules should now be available, you can verify using the command:

```powershell
Get-Module -ListAvailable
```

Example Output:

```
PS C:\Users\Phrozen\Desktop> Get-Module -ListAvailable


    Directory: C:\Users\Phrozen\Documents\WindowsPowerShell\Modules

```powershell
Invoke-RemoteDesktopViewer -ServerAddress "127.0.0.1" -ServerPort 2801 -SecurePassword (ConvertTo-SecureString -String "urCompl3xP@ssw0rd" -AsPlainText -Force)
```

#### Enumerate Trusted Servers

When connecting to a new remote server for the first time, the viewer will ask if you want to trust the server's fingerprint. If you select the option to 'Always' trust this fingerprint, it will be saved in the local user registry. You can revoke the trust for this fingerprint at any time using the appropriate function.

```powershell
Get-TrustedServers
```

##### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notices

1. It is recommended to use SecurePassword instead of a plain-text password, even if the plain-text password is being converted to a SecureString.
2. If you do not specify a custom certificate using 'CertificateFile' or 'EncodedCertificate', a default self-signed certificate will be generated and installed user certificate store.
3. If you do not specify a SecurePassword or Password, a random, complex password will be generated and displayed in the terminal (this password is temporary).

##### Examples

```powershell
Invoke-RemoteDesktopServer -ListenAddress "0.0.0.0" -ListenPort 2801 -SecurePassword (ConvertTo-SecureString -String "urCompl3xP@ssw0rd" -AsPlainText -Force)

Invoke-RemoteDesktopServer -ListenAddress "0.0.0.0" -ListenPort 2801 -SecurePassword (ConvertTo-SecureString -String "urCompl3xP@ssw0rd" -AsPlainText -Force) -CertificateFile "c:\certs\phrozen.p12"
```

#### How to capture LogonUI

As of version 4.0.0, it is possible to capture the LogonUI/Winlogon (UAC Prompt, Windows Login Window, CTRL+ALT+DEL, etc.). 

However, in order to capture the LogonUI, the server must be run under the context of 'NT AUTHORITY/System' in the current active session. 

There are multiple methods for spawning a process as the SYSTEM user in the active session (e.g., PsExec, Process Hacker), but for simplicity I recommend using my PowerRunAsSystem project (available on GitHub and installable through the PowerShell Gallery).

````powershell
Install-Module -Name PowerRunAsSystem
````

Then run bellow command as Administrator.

```powershell
Invoke-InteractiveSystemPowerShell
```

A new PowerShell terminal should appear on your desktop as **NT AUTHORITY/System**

If you follow the steps above, a new PowerShell terminal should appear on your desktop running as the 'NT AUTHORITY/System' user.

From this terminal, you can run the Power Remote Desktop server command and enable the 'LogonUI' option for future Power Remote Desktop viewer connections. 

##### Generate your Certificate

```
openssl req -x509 -sha512 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout phrozen.key -out phrozen.crt
```

Then export the new certificate (**must include private key**).

```
openssl pkcs12 -export -out phrozen.p12 -inkey phrozen.key -in phrozen.crt
```

##### Integrate to server as a file

Use `CertificateFile`. Example: `c:\tlscert\phrozen.crt`

##### Integrate to server as a base64 representation

Encode an existing certificate using PowerShell

```powershell
[convert]::ToBase64String((Get-Content -path "c:\tlscert\phrozen.crt" -Encoding byte))
```
or on Linux / Mac systems

```
base64 -i /tmp/phrozen.p12
```

You can then pass the output base64 certificate file to parameter `EncodedCertificate` (One line)
